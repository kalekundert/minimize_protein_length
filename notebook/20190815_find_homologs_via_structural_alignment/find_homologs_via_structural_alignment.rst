Find homologs via structural alignment
**************************************

I had the thought that we could use structural alignments to find proteins with 
similar folds, even if their sequences are quite different.  My hope was that 
this would give alignments that had both good diversity and good quality, 
despite the fact that the PDB is much smaller than the sequence databases.

I have not really investigated this idea yet.
